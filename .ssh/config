# What the fuck man. Stop polluting my config files with your clever shit. My
# config files are checked in to a Git repo and synced on all boxes I have,
# Linux, Windows, or macOS without OrbStack installed. You are just creating
# difficulties for anyone who already had a substantial use of Linux. Also, you
# are outright lying, this include works well in my per machine ssh config so
# it definitely does not only work if it's at the top of ssh_config.
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Added by OrbStack: 'orb' SSH host for Linux machines
# This only works if it's at the top of ssh_config (before any Host blocks).
# Comment this line if you don't want it to be added again.
